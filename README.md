Fridge Compiler

### What and why?

The software that our team proposes is one that takes into account all items in a refridgerator, and then spits out all possible recipes to be made with the food at hand. This would be further categorized into health needs - those who need.want a Keto diet, for example, would be able to filter by such. Some more filters would include College Meals, Vegan and Vegetarian options, as well as Gluten Free options. 

Oftentimes, college students resort to eating out, or ordering in on Uber Eats when they are too lazy to think of what to cook. The proposed software fixes the problem of having food in the refridgerator at home, but not knowing what to eat. It would not only solve the problem of thinking about recipes, but the software would come up with MULTIPLE ideas, so that you would have options from different cuisines. If you were to lack in some ingredients, it would also tell you what you would need for the specified dish. Moreover, it would ultimately save the user money, and could be used as a meal planning/prepping tool.

### For whom?

The targeted customer base would be people who are on the go, and do not have much leisure time to cook frequently. Some people that would constitute this description would be college students, corporate individuals who work long hours, or parents who aren't too cooking savvy

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

Although integration into a refridgerator screen would be optimal, our implementation will start as a website. The end user would plug in their fridge contents, and the amount they have. When they select the meal that they want to cook, the ingredients would immediately be taken out of the ingredients list. Whenever grocery shopping is done, the user could add what they bought, or if the grocery shopping is done online, there could be a feature that automatically fills up your inventory. 

### Scope

A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

## Submission

Complete the assignment as a Markdown document in the file named `README.md` in this repository. The message should be nicely formatted and outlined with a clear heading and sub-headings for each section.

Use the `git` features of **Visual Studio Code** to commit your work and `push` them to the GitHub repository.

Share the link to your document in your private assignments Discord channel AND in the public #project-ideas channel. In both cases, include the title of your project for all to see in the message.

## What happens next

We will select a subset of the proposals that we think will be the most interesting and appropriate for this course. These will be published to the class. Your next assignment will be to rank your favorites. We will then make team assignments based on this information and the answers you have provided to the previous introductory questionnaire.

If your proposal is selected, you are 99% guaranteed to be part of that team.
